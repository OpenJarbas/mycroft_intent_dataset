en-us,hubble-telescope.about,The Hubble Space Telescope is a space telescope that was launched into low Earth orbit in 1990 and remains in operation. It was not the first space telescope but it is one of the largest and most versatile well known both as a vital research tool and as a public relations boon for astronomy.
en-us,hubble-telescope.hubble,The image was taken while the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph was aimed at a different part of the moon to measure the colors of sunlight reflected off the Moon. The picture at upper left is a full view of the moon taken by a terrestrial telescope. The wide central image is Hubble's crisp bird's-eye view which clearly shows the ray pattern of bright dust ejected out of the crater over one billion years ago when an asteroid larger than a mile across slammed into the Moon. A close-up view of Copernicus's terraced walls is shown at lower right.
en-us,hubble-telescope.hubble.colors,There are no natural color cameras aboard Hubble and there never have been. The optical cameras on board have all been digital CCD cameras which take images as grayscale pixels but use colored filters to isolate different colors in each image. Sometimes the color in the images is as natural as possible. However the color given to the images is not just artistic embellishment. The images are indeed downloaded as black and white and color is added for a number of different reasons — for example to show the location of chemical elements and highlight features so subdued that the human eye cannot see them.
en-us,hubble-telescope.hubble.data.public,Astronomers who requested the data generally have six months to publish their findings before the data are publicly released.
en-us,hubble-telescope.hubble.earth,The surface of the Earth is whizzing by as Hubble orbits and the pointing system designed to track the distant stars cannot track an object on the Earth. The shortest exposure time on any of the Hubble instruments is 0.1 seconds and in this time Hubble moves almost half a mile about 700 meters. A picture Hubble took of Earth would be completely streaked.
en-us,hubble-telescope.hubble.how,Hubble is a Cassegrain telescope — a type of reflecting telescope. Light enters the telescope and strikes the large primary or main mirror. The light is then reflected from the primary mirror onto the secondary mirror which then focuses the light back through a hole in the primary mirror to a point behind that mirror where the science instruments are located. Hubble’s primary mirror is 94.5 inches (2.4 meters) in diameter.
en-us,hubble-telescope.hubble.instruments,Hubble collects light from celestial objects and directs it to the telescope’s science instruments. Hubble’s current suite of instruments includes the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS).
en-us,hubble-telescope.hubble.live,While there is no “real time” camera or webcam on board the telescope for live relay links you can find out what Hubble is observing at any time by visiting Space Telescope Live. Usually Hubble is looking at these targets for the first time so the images you will see there are from other telescopes but give you an idea of where Hubble is looking.
en-us,hubble-telescope.hubble.mission,When launched the primary objectives of the Hubble Space Telescope were to investigate the constitution physical characteristics and dynamics of celestial bodies determine the nature of processes occurring in stellar and galactic objects study the history and evolution of the universe confirm universality of physical laws provide a long-term space research facility for optical astronomy
en-us,hubble-telescope.hubble.moon,An object on the Moon even the size of a large house is too small to resolve. So anything we left on the Moon cannot be resolved in any Hubble image. It would just appear as a dot blended with its surroundings.
en-us,hubble-telescope.hubble.moon.caption,at upper left is a full view of the moon taken by a terrestrial telescope. The wide central image is Hubble's crisp bird's-eye view which clearly shows the ray pattern of bright dust ejected out of the crater over one billion years ago when an asteroid larger than a mile across slammed into the Moon. A close-up view of Copernicus's terraced walls is shown at lower right.
en-us,hubble-telescope.hubble.planets,Hubble is not looking for new planets in our own solar system but the search for planets around other stars is very active. Hubble has achieved direct detection of several different exoplanets though they are still too small and far away to resolve details.
en-us,hubble-telescope.hubble.when,Hubble was launched aboard the space shuttle Discovery (STS-31) on April 24 1990. It was deployed into orbit the following day April 25 1990.
en-us,hubble-telescope.hubble.where,Hubble orbits the Earth at an altitude of about {{altitude}} miles inclined 28.5 degrees to the equator. This vantage point is above the negative effects of Earth’s atmosphere.  Traveling at a speed of about {{speed}} miles per hour Hubble takes about 95 minutes to complete one orbit around Earth.
en-us,hubble-telescope.hubble.where.metric,Hubble orbits the Earth at an altitude of about {{altitude}} kilometers inclined 28.5 degrees to the equator. This vantage point is above the negative effects of Earth’s atmosphere.  Traveling at a speed of about {{speed}} kilometers per hour Hubble takes about 95 minutes to complete one orbit around Earth.
en-us,hubble-telescope.hubble.who,astronomer Edwin Powell Hubble made some of the most important discoveries in modern astronomy. In the 1920s Hubble showed that some of the numerous distant faint clouds of light in the universe were actually entire galaxies. The realization that the Milky Way is only one of many galaxies forever changed the way humanity views our place in the universe. But perhaps his greatest discovery came in 1929 when Hubble determined that the farther a galaxy is from Earth the faster it appears to move away. This notion of an expanding universe formed the basis of the big bang theory which states that the universe began with an intense burst of energy at a single moment in time and has been expanding ever since.
en-us,hubble-telescope.hubble.why,Shifting pockets of air in Earth’s atmosphere distort light from space — that’s why stars seem to twinkle when viewed from the ground. The atmosphere also blocks some wavelengths of light partially or entirely particularly ultraviolet light. This makes space the only place where a telescope can get a truly clear and comprehensive view of the universe

en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,God is the name people give to the reason we are here.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,God may exist but science can explain the universe without the need for a creator.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,However difficult life may seem there is always something you can do and succeed at.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,I am just a child who has never grown up. I still keep asking these 'how' and 'why' questions. Occasionally I find an answer.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,I believe alien life is quite common in the universe although intelligent life is less so. Some say it has yet to appear on planet Earth.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,I believe there are no questions that science can't answer about a physical universe.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,I have found far greater enthusiasm for science in America than here in Britain. There is more enthusiasm for everything in America.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,I have noticed even people who claim everything is predestined and that we can do nothing to change it look before they cross the road.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,In my opinion there is no aspect of reality beyond the reach of the human mind.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,Life would be tragic if it weren't funny.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,Many people find the universe confusing -- it's not.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,People who boast about their IQ are losers.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,People won't have time for you if you are always angry or complaining.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,Science can lift people out of poverty and cure disease. That in turn will reduce civil unrest.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,Science is increasingly answering questions that used to be the province of religion.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,Science is not only a disciple of reason but also one of romance and passion.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,Scientists have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,The past like the future is indefinite and exists only as a spectrum of possibilities.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,The universe is not indifferent to our existence -- it depends on it.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,There is no unique picture of reality.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,There is nothing bigger or older than the universe.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the universe. That makes us something very special.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,When one's expectations are reduced to zero one really appreciates everything one does have.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,Work gives you meaning and purpose and life is empty without it.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,My goal is simple. It is a complete understanding of the universe why it is as it is and why it exists at all.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,It would not be much of a universe if it wasn't home to the people you love.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,Life would be tragic if it weren't funny
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,Einstein was wrong when he said 'God does not play dice'. Consideration of black holes suggests not only that God does play dice but that he sometimes confuses us by throwing them where they can't be seen
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,Without imperfection you or I would not exist
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,The victim should have the right to end his life if he wants. But I think it would be a great mistake. However bad life may seem there is always something you can do and succeed at. While there's life there is hope
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,I think it would be a disaster. The extraterrestrials would probably be far in advance of us. The history of advanced races meeting more primitive people on this planet is not very happy and they were the same species. I think we should keep our heads low
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,I fear that AI may replace humans altogether. If people design computer viruses someone will design AI that improves and replicates itself. This will be a new form of life that outperforms humans.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,I believe there is no deep difference between what can be achieved by a biological brain and what can be achieved by a computer. It therefore follows that computers can in theory emulate human intelligence - and exceed it.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,If you are disabled it is probably not your fault but it is no good blaming the world or expecting it to take pity on you. One has to have a positive attitude and must make the best of the situation that one finds oneself in
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,What I have done is to show that it is possible for the way the universe began to be determined by the laws of science. In that case it would not be necessary to appeal to God to decide how the universe began. This doesn't prove that there is no God only that God is not necessary.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,On quantum physics: These lectures have shown very clearly the difference between Roger and me. He's a Platonist and I'm a positivist. He's worried that Schrödinger's cat is in a quantum state where it is half alive and half dead. He feels that can't correspond to reality. But that doesn't bother me. I don't demand that a theory correspond to reality because I don't know what it is. Reality is not a quality you can test with litmus paper. All I'm concerned with is that the theory should predict the results of measurements. Quantum theory does this very successfully. It predicts that the result of an observation is either that the cat is alive or that it is dead. It is like you can't be slightly pregnant: you either are or you aren't.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,The human race is just a chemical scum on a moderate-sized planet orbiting around a very average star in the outer suburb of one among a hundred billion galaxies. We are so insignificant that I can't believe the whole universe exists for our benefit. That would be like saying that you would disappear if I closed my eyes.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,I think computer viruses should count as life … I think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive. We've created life in our own image.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,All my life I have been fascinated by the big questions that face us and have tried to find scientific answers to them.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,The world has changed far more in the past 100 years than in any other century in history. The reason is not political or economic but technological — technologies that flowed directly from advances in basic science.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,Although September 11 was horrible it didn't threaten the survival of the human race like nuclear weapons do.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,I don't think the human race will survive the next thousand years unless we spread into space. There are too many accidents that can befall life on a single planet. But I'm an optimist. We will reach out to the stars.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,We shouldn't be surprised that conditions in the universe are suitable for life but this is not evidence that the universe was designed to allow for life. We could call order by the name of God but it would be an impersonal God. There's not much personal about the laws of physics.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,I am discounting reports of UFOs. Why would they appear only to cranks and weirdos?
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,The life we have on Earth must have spontaneously generated itself. It must therefore be possible for life to generate spontaneously elsewhere in the universe.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,Evolution has ensured that our brains just aren't equipped to visualise 11 dimensions directly. However from a purely mathematical point of view it's just as easy to think in 11 dimensions as it is to think in three or four.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,I think that it's important for scientists to explain their work particularly in cosmology. This now answers many questions once asked of religion.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,Equations are just the boring part of mathematics. I attempt to see things in terms of geometry.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,The danger is that global warming may become self-sustaining if it has not done so already. The melting of the Arctic and Antarctic ice caps reduces the fraction of solar energy reflected back into space and so increases the temperature further. Climate change may kill off the Amazon and other rain forests and so eliminate once one of the main ways in which carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere. The rise in sea temperature may trigger the release of large quantities of carbon dioxide trapped as hydrides on the ocean floor. Both these phenomena would increase the greenhouse effect and so global warming further. We have to reverse global warming urgently if we still can.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,I'm not religious in the normal sense. I believe the universe is governed by the laws of science. The laws may have been decreed by God but God does not intervene to break the laws.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,In a world that is in chaos politically socially and environmentally how can the human race sustain another 100 years?
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,To confine our attention to terrestrial matters would be to limit the human spirit.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,There is a fundamental difference between religion which is based on authority and science which is based on observation and reason. Science will win because it works.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,We should seek the greatest value of our action
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,Science predicts that many different kinds of universe will be spontaneously created out of nothing. It is a matter of chance which we are in.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,Women. They are a complete mystery.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,One remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Two never give up work. Work gives you meaning and purpose and life is empty without it. Three if you are lucky enough to find love remember it is there and don't throw it away.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,We are all different — but we share the same human spirit. Perhaps it's human nature that we adapt — and survive.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,It has certainly been true in the past that what we call intelligence and scientific discovery have conveyed a survival advantage. It is not so clear that this is still the case: our scientific discoveries may well destroy us all
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,The whole history of science has been the gradual realization that events do not happen in an arbitrary manner but that they reflect a certain underlying order which may or may not be divinely inspired.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,Galileo perhaps more than any other single person was responsible for the birth of modern science.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,Just like a computer we must remember things in the order in which entropy increases. This makes the second law of thermodynamics almost trivial. Disorder increases with time because we measure time in the direction in which disorder increases. You can’t have a safer bet than that!
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,One could say: The boundary condition of the universe is that it has no boundary. The universe would be completely self-contained and not affected by anything outside itself. It would neither be created nor destroyed. It would just BE.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe? The usual approach of science of constructing a mathematical model cannot answer the questions of why there should be a universe for the model to describe. Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing?
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,I have noticed that even people who claim everything is predetermined and that we can do nothing to change it look before they cross the road.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,When I gave a lecture in Japan I was asked not to mention the possible re-collapse of the universe because it might affect the stock market. However I can re-assure anyone who is nervous about their investments that it is a bit early to sell: even if the universe does come to an end it won't be for at least twenty billion years.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,The universe would have expanded in a smooth way from a single point. As it expanded it would have borrowed energy from the gravitational field to create matter. As any economist could have predicted the result of all that borrowing was inflation. The universe expanded and borrowed at an ever-increasing rate. Fortunately the debt of gravitational energy will not have to be repaid until the end of the universe.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,Mathematics is more than a tool and language for science. It is also an end in itself and as such it has over the centuries affected our worldview in its own right.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,If aliens visit us the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America which didn't turn out well for the Native Americans. … We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn't want to meet.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,We are each free to believe what we want and it is my view that the simplest explanation is there is no God. No one created the universe and no one directs our fate. This leads me to a profound realization. There is probably no heaven and no afterlife either. We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe and for that I am extremely grateful
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race. We cannot quite know what will happen if a machine exceeds our own intelligence so we can't know if we'll be infinitely helped by it or ignored by it and sidelined or conceivably destroyed by it.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,If machines produce everything we need the outcome will depend on how things are distributed. Everyone can enjoy a life of luxurious leisure if the machine-produced wealth is shared or most people can end up miserably poor if the machine-owners successfully lobby against wealth redistribution. So far the trend seems to be toward the second option with technology driving ever-increasing inequality.
en-us,stephen-hawking.quote,Any physical theory is always provisional in the sense that it is only a hypothesis: you can never prove it. No matter how many times the results of experiments agree with some theory you can never be sure that the next time the result will not contradict the theory.  Each time new experiments are observed to agree with the predictions the theory survives and our confidence in it is increased; but if ever a new observation is found to disagree we have to abandon or modify the theory.
